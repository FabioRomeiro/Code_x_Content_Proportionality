# HTML Code x Content Proportionality

## The problem

When dealing with SEO, an important metric to keep track is the proportionality between content and HTML code.
The propotionality becomes a problem when the amount of code surpasses in 10% or more the amount of text on
the page.

This affects SEO since the less code your page has, faster it will load. Besides, the more content your page has,
the more search engines might consider it relevant.

## The calculator

With this calculator you can calculate this propotionality on a given code.

## Running the project

Open the `index.html` file with your browser.

Or use docker for local development:

`docker-compose up`
